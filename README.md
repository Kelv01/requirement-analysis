# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in Software Development, a crucial phase that defines the foundation for building successful software solutions.  
Its purpose is to gather, analyze, and document stakeholder needs to ensure the final product meets business objectives and user expectations.  
By clearly outlining functional and non-functional requirements, this repository serves as a reference point for developers, designers, and project managers, helping to maintain alignment, minimize rework, and guide the entire development process with clarity and precision.  



# What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.  
This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform.  



# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

| Title | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **Clarity and Understanding** | Helps in understanding what stakeholders expect from the software, reducing ambiguity. |
| **Scope Definition** | Clearly defines the scope of the project, which helps prevent scope creep. |
| **Basis for Design and Development** | Provides a solid foundation for designing and developing the system. |
| **Cost and Time Estimation** | Facilitates accurate estimation of project cost, resources, and time. |
| **Quality Assurance** | Ensures the final product meets specified requirements, leading to higher customer satisfaction. |

  Conduct brainstorming sessions to generate creative ideas and collect diverse perspectives on requirements.  

- **Focus Groups**  
  Hold focused group discussions with selected stakeholders to gather detailed insights and refine needs.  

- **Prototyping**  
  Create prototypes or mockups to help stakeholders visualize system features and refine their requirements.  



### Requirement Documentation  

- **Requirement Specification Document**  
  Create a detailed document listing all functional and non-functional requirements clearly.  

- **User Stories**  
  Write user stories to describe functionalities from the user’s perspective in simple, goal-oriented language.  

- **Use Cases**  
  Develop use case diagrams to illustrate how users interact with the system and achieve specific outcomes.  



### Requirement Analysis and Modeling  

- **Requirement Prioritization**  
  Prioritize requirements based on their importance, business value, and overall impact on the project.  

- **Feasibility Analysis**  
  Assess the feasibility of requirements in terms of technical complexity, budget, and time constraints.  

- **Modeling**  
  Create visual representations like data flow diagrams and entity-relationship diagrams to analyze and clarify requirements.  



### Requirement Validation  

- **Review and Approval**  
  Review documented requirements with stakeholders to ensure they are accurate, complete, and aligned with project goals.  

- **Acceptance Criteria**  
  Define clear, measurable acceptance criteria for each requirement to ensure they meet expected standards.  

- **Traceability**  
  Establish traceability matrices to confirm all requirements are implemented, tested, and verified throughout the development process.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements  
**Definition:**  
Describe what the system should do, the features, behaviors, and specific operations the system must perform to meet user needs.  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**  

- **Search Properties**  
  Allow users to search for available properties based on location, price range, dates, and property type for better discovery.  

- **User Registration**  
  Enable new users to create an account with personal information and secure credentials.  

- **Property Listings**  
  Display property details such as images, pricing, amenities, and availability to help users make informed choices.  

- **Booking System**  
  Support users in reserving properties, confirming bookings, viewing booking history, and managing cancellations.  

- **User Authentication**  
  Provide secure login and registration using encryption and validation to protect user data.  



### Non-functional Requirements  
**Definition:**  
Describe how the system should perform rather than specific features, focusing on quality attributes like performance, security, and usability.  

**Examples for Booking Management System:**  

- **Performance**  
  Pages should load within 2 seconds and handle up to 1000 concurrent users efficiently.  

- **Security**  
  Implement encryption for sensitive data, enforce secure logins, and prevent common attacks such as SQL injection or XSS.  

- **Scalability**  
  The system should scale horizontally to manage growth in user traffic and database load.  

- **Usability**  
  Ensure an intuitive, responsive interface with simple navigation so users can complete tasks easily on any device.  

- **Reliability**  
  Maintain at least 99.9% uptime with fast recovery mechanisms to minimize downtime and data loss.

  ## Use Case Diagrams   

**Objective:**  
Provide a visual representation of how different users interact with the booking management system.  

### **What are Use Case Diagrams?**  
Use case diagrams illustrate the interactions between users (actors) and the system to achieve specific goals (use cases). They help define system boundaries and clarify the relationships between functionalities and stakeholders.  

### **Creating Use Case Diagrams**  

- **Identify Actors**  
  Determine who will interact with the system, such as **Guest**, **Registered User**, and **Admin**.  

- **Define Use Cases**  
  Outline what each actor can do within the system.  
  Examples include:  
  - Search Properties  
  - Book Property  
  - Manage Listings  
  - Register / Login  
  - View Bookings  
  - Update Property Details  

- **Draw Interactions**  
  Show the relationships between actors and their corresponding use cases using connectors or association lines.  

### **Benefits of Use Case Diagrams**  

- **Clear Visual Representation**  
  Provide a simple yet powerful overview of the system’s main functionalities and user interactions.  

- **Requirement Organization**  
  Help identify and group system requirements logically for better understanding.  

- **Enhanced Communication**  
  Facilitate clearer discussions between stakeholders, analysts, and developers.

## Acceptance Criteria 

**Objective:** Establishing clear criteria for feature completion.  

### What is Acceptance Criteria?  
Acceptance criteria are specific, measurable conditions that a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders.  
They ensure that everyone — from developers to clients — understands when a feature is considered "done."  

### How to Define Acceptance Criteria  
- **Be specific and measurable** — clearly outline what success looks like.  
- **Include both functional and non-functional aspects** — cover behavior, performance, and usability.  
- **Keep them testable** — criteria should be verifiable through testing or user validation.  

### Example: Checkout Feature (Booking System)  
**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Users can add selected properties to a checkout list.  
- Users can review booking details before confirming.  
- Payment is processed securely through the integrated gateway.  
- Upon successful payment, users receive a confirmation email within **2 minutes**.  
- The system prevents duplicate bookings for the same dates.  

### Benefits of Acceptance Criteria  
- Ensure all parties have a shared understanding of feature expectations.  
- Provide a **clear benchmark** for testing and validation.  
- Help maintain **quality**, **transparency**, and **user satisfaction**.
