# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository focuses on Requirement Analysis in Software Development. 
a crucial phase that defines the foundation for building successful software solutions.
Its purpose is to gather, analyze, and document stakeholder needs to ensure the final
product meets business objectives and user expectations. By clearly outlining functional
and non-functional requirements, this repository serves as a reference point for developers,
designers, and project managers, helping to maintain alignment, minimize rework,
and guide the entire development process with clarity and precision.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) where 
the project team gathers, analyzes, and defines the requirements of the software product to be developed.
This process ensures that all stakeholders have a clear and mutual understanding of what the system should 
do and how it should perform.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
